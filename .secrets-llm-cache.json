    "rationale": "The code directly assigns a password ('securepassword123') to a variable within the source code. This is a common anti-pattern and represents a significant security risk as it exposes the password in plain text. While the comment '# IGNORE' attempts to dismiss the risk, the presence of a hardcoded password necessitates immediate remediation.",
    "suggested_fix": "Avoid hardcoding passwords directly in the source code. Instead, retrieve passwords from a secure configuration file, environment variable, or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  If the password is truly static and cannot be retrieved from elsewhere, consider encrypting it and decrypting it at runtime, although this adds complexity and isn't a perfect solution."
